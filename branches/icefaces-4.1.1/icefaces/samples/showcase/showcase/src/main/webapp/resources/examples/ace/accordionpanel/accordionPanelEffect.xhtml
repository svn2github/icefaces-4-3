It has been the industry's standard dummy text since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a book. Lorem Ipsum has survived not only five centuries, but also, remained essentially unchanged. It become popular in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software which include different part of Lorem Ipsum." />

It has roots comming from classical Latin literature written in 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, discovered the undoubtable source of this text. Lorem Ipsum comes from two sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of 'de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum' (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero, written in 45 BC. This book covers the theory of ethics, very popular during the Renaissance." />

No one rejects, dislikes, or avoids pleasure itself, because it is pleasure, but because those who do not know how to pursue pleasure rationally encounter consequences that are extremely painful. Nor again is there anyone who loves or pursues or desires to obtain pain of itself, because it is pain, but because occasionally circumstances occur in which toil and pain can procure him some great pleasure. To take a trivial example, which of us ever undertakes laborious physical exercise, except to obtain some advantage from it? But who has any right to find fault with a man who chooses to enjoy a pleasure that has no annoying consequences, or one who avoids a pain that produces no resultant pleasure?"/>
