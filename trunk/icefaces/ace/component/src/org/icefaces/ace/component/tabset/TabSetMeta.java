        "each of which may contain any arbitrary components. Only one " +
        "TabPane component is currently active, and its contents shown, " +
        "at any given time. The TabSet may operate in a server-side mode, " +
        "where only the current TabPane's contents exist in the browser; or " +
        "in client-side mode, where every TabPane's contents exist in the " +
        "browser, and no server round-trip is necessary to change TabPanes. " +
        "The entire TabSet may exist within a single parent form, so that " +
        "validation will apply to all of its contents, and so that " +
        "validation may enforce remaining on the current TabPane if the " +
        "user attempts to change the selected TabPane while other input " +
        "components are in an invalid state. Also, a TabSet may exist " +
        "outside of any form, perhaps with each TabPane containing their " +
        "own child form, so that validation may be more limited in scope. " +
        "In this case, a TabSetProxy may be used, in conjunction with the " +
        "TabSet, so that the TabSetProxy may be placed in a form, for " +
        "communicating with the server, removing the need for the TabSet " +
        "itself to be in a form. When changing the selected TabPane, the " +
        "TabSet may use application configurable animations to accentuate " +
        "the transition from the previously selected TabPane to the newly " +
        "selected TabPane. The label portion of the TabPanes may be shown " +
        "on the bottom, top, left, or right of the TabSet. To support the " +
        "capability of dynamically adding and removing TabPane(s) without " +
        "updating the entire TabSet, there is a side-effect where any " +
        "iframe(s) within them can get loaded twice in rapid succession, " +
        "when first shown or subsequently updated. To eliminate the " +
        "redundant load by deferring the loading until the TabSet is ready, " +
        "do not use a src attribute on the iframe(s), but rather set the " +
        "org.icefaces.ace.component.tabset.deferred_src attribute to what " +
        "src would have been.<p>For more information, see the " +
