	<p>ICEfaces is an open-source Rich Internet Application (RIA)
		development framework based on the JavaServer Faces 2 standard.
		ICEfaces extends JavaServer Faces to simplify development and enhance
		the standard JSF feature set - simultaneously improving developer
		efficiency and expanding the spectrum of RIA capabilities that can be
		included in any JSF-based web application.</p>
