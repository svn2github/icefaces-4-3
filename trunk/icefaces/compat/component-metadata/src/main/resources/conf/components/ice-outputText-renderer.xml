	<description>
		If the "styleClass" or "style" attributes are present, render a
		"span" element. If the "styleClass" attribute is present, render
		its value as the value of the "class" attribute. If the "style"
		attribute is present, pass it thru. If the "escape" attribute is
		not present, or it is present and its value is "true" all angle
		brackets should be converted to the ampersand xx semicolon
		syntax when rendering the value of the "value" attribute as the
		value of the component. If the "escape" attribute is present and
		is "false" the value of the component should be rendered as text
		without escaping.
