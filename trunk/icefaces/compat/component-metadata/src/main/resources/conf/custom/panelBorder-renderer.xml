	         <![CDATA[<p>The panelBorder is a layout container component that arranges and resizes specified child
            containers to fit in five regions: north, south, east, west, and center. These regions are
            defined using facets.<br>
            The panelBorder component can be used to provide a general layout scheme for a page.<br>
            Note: A panelBorder facet needs a container type component as a child (e.g.,
            panelGroup, panelGrid or form). panelGroup renders a span tag, which doesn't
            work properly if using Mozilla. panelGrid can be used to avoid display problems. ]]>
