		<![CDATA[<p>The panelStack is a container component that itself contains multiple panel groups.
            A single contained panel group is visible at one time, filling the area covered by
            the panelStack component. The panel group specified in the selectPanel attribute will
            be visible, with the others being hidden.<br>
            The panelStack component can be used in cases where a form region must contain several embedded
            panels, only one of which is visible at one time, changing dynamically depending on an application
            state change or user selection. ]]>
