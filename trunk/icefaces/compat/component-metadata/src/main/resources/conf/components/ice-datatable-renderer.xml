	<description><![CDATA[<p>Renders an HTML "table" element compliant with the HTML 401
          specification.  Please consult the javadoc for <code>UIData</code>
          to supplement this specification.  If the "styleClass" attribute
          is specified, render its value as the value of the "class"
          attribute on the "table" element.  Any pass-through attributes are
          also rendered on the "table" element.  </p><p>Rendering the header</p><ul><p>If the <code>UIData</code> component has a "header" facet, or
          any of the child <code>UIColumn</code> components has a "header"
          facet, render a "thead" element.  If the <code>UIData</code>
          component has a "header" facet, encode its contents inside of "tr"
          and "th" elements, respectively.  Output the value of the
          "headerClass" attribute of the <code>UIData</code> component, if
          present, as the value of the "class" attribute on the "th".
          Output the number of child <code>UIColumn</code> components of the
          <code>UIData</code> component as the value of the "colspan"
          attribute on the "th".  Output "colgroup" as the value of the
          "scope" attribute on the "th" element. </p><p>If any of the child <code>UIColumn</code> components has a
          "header" facet render a "tr" element.  For each
          <code>UIColumn</code> that actually has a "header" facet, render
          it inside of a "th" element.  Columns that don't have a "header"
          facet cause an empty "th" element to be rendered.  Output the
          value of the "headerClass" attribute of the <code>UIData</code>
          component, if present, as the value of the "class" attribute on
          the "th".  Output "col" as the value of the "colgroup" attribute
          on the "th" element.
          </p><p>Close out the "thead" element.</p></ul><p>Rendering the footer</p><ul><p>Follow the same process as for the header, except replace
          "header" with "footer", "th" with "td", "thead" with "tfoot", and
          "headerClass" with "footerClass".  Do not render any "scope"
          attribute for the footer.</p></ul><p>Rendering the table body</p><ul><p>Render a "tbody" element.  Keep track of the result of the
          "rows" property on the <code>UIData</code> component.  Keep track
          of the number of rows we have rendered so far.  Iterate through
          the rows.  Set the "rowIndex" property of the <code>UIData</code>
          component to be correct as we iterate through the rows.  Stop
          rendering children and close out the "tbody" element if the
          "rowAvailable" property of the <code>UIData</code> returned false.
          Output a "tr" element.  Output the value of the "rowClasses" per
          the attribute description below.  For each <code>UIColumn</code>
          child, output a "td" element, attaching the value of the
          "columnClasses" attribute of the <code>UIData</code> component per
          the attribute description below.  Recursively encode each child of
          each <code>UIColumn</code> child.  Close out the "td" element.
          When done with the row, close out the "tr" element.  When done
          with all the rows, close out the "tbody" element.</p></ul><p>When done rendering all the rows, set the "rowIndex" property of
         the <code>UIData</code> to -1, and close out the "table"
         element.</p>]]>
