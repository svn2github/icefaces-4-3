		<![CDATA[<p>The panelSeries component provides a mechanism for dynamically generating a series of repeating
            child-components within a panel. This component renders its child components in an iterative fashion
            similar to way the dataTable component renders data rows. However, the panelSeries component is more 
            flexibile in that it can render a series of arbitrarily complex child components. The dataset can be 
            defined and used by implementing the value and var attributes respectively.
