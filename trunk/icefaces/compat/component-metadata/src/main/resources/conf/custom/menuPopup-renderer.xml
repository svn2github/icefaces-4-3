        <![CDATA[
        <p> A context sensitive popup menu providing popup nested child menus</p>
        <p> By default the menuPopup doesn't cause any submit when displayed by 
        the right click, that is why its contents can be static only but it could be 
        dynamic by just registering the displayListener on it. The displayEvent 
        gives the target component as well as the clientId of the target 
        component in form of contextValue, which then can be use to produce dynamic 
        contents.
        </p>
