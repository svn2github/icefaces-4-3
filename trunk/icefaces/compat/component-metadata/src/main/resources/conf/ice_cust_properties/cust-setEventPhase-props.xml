		The types of events that should be changed to be broadcasted in the 
        different phase. Specified as a space delimited list of event class 
        names. If a short version of the class name is given, without a 
        package name, then "javax.faces.event" will be assumed. An event will 
        be determined to match the entries in this property if it passes the 
        instanceof test, meaning that if it is exactly that class, or is a
        subclass. If all events should have their phase changed, simply specify
        FacesEvent as the value of this property.
