		<![CDATA[<p>Render an HTML "a" anchor element that acts like a
          form submit button when clicked.</p><p>General Behaviour</p><p>Both the encode and decode behavior require the ability to get
          the id/name for a hidden field whose value is set by the
          JavaScript form submit.  This name must be constructed as
          follows:</p><ul><li><p>Get the clientId for the form of which this component is a
          child.</p></li><li><p>Append
          <code>NamingContainer.SEPARATOR_CHAR</code>.</p></li><li><p>Append a constant string that is the same for all command
          link components in the tree.</p></li></ul><p>In the following text, this String is called
          hiddenFieldName.</p><p>Decode Behavior</p><ul><p>Obtain the "clientId" property of the component.  Obtain the
          <code>Map</code> from the "requestParameterMap" property of the
          <code>ExternalContext</code>.  Derive hiddenFieldName as above.
          Get the entry in the <code>Map</code> under the key that is the
          hiddenFieldName.  If the there is no entry, or the entry is the
          empty String, or the entry is not equal to the value of the
          "clientId" property, return immediately.  If there is an entry,
          and its value is equal to the value of the "clientId" property,
          create a new <code>javax.faces.event.ActionEvent</code> instance
          around the component and call <code>queueActionEvent()</code> on
          the component, passing the event.</p></ul><p>Encode Behavior</p><ul><p>Render "#" as the value of the "href" attribute. Render the current 
          value of the component as the link text if it is specified. Render 
          javascript that is functionally equivalent to the following as the value 
          of the "onclick" attribute:</p><p><code>document.forms['CLIENT_ID']['hiddenFieldName'].value='CLIENT_ID';
          document.forms['CLIENT_ID']['PARAM1_NAME'].value='PARAM1_VALUE';
          document.forms['CLIENT_ID']['PARAM2_NAME'].value='PARAM2_VALUE';
          return false;</code></p><p>document.forms['CLIENT_ID'].submit()" where hiddenFieldName is
          as described above, CLIENT_ID is the clientId of the UICommand
          component, PARAM*_NAME and PARAM*_VALUE are the names and values,
          respectively, of any nested UIParameter children.  The name and
          the value must be URLEncoded.  If the "styleClass" attribute is
          specified, render its value as the value of the "class" attribute.
          Render any non-UIParameter children as normal inside of the "a"
          element.  These will appear as the link text.  Allow the form
          renderer to output a single "input" element (for the entire page,
          regardless of how many command link components are in the page) of
          "type" "hidden" whose "name" is the value of hiddenFieldName, and
          which must not have a "value" attribute.  Multiple occurrences of
          command link components in the tree should not cause multiple
          hiddenFieldName hidden fields.  Allow the form renderer to output
          an "input" element of "type" "hidden" for each of the nested
          UIParameter children, taking the name property (but not the value)
          from each one in turn.</p></ul>]]>
