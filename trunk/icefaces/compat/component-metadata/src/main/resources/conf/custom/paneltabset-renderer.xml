	<![CDATA[<p>The panelTabSet is a container component which itself contains one or more panelTab
            components, which are  also container components. The panelTabSet component displays the "active"
            panelTab, hiding the contents of the others. Users can select which panelTab to make visible by 
            clicking on the tab header of the panelTab that they want to display.<br>
            The panelTabSet component can be used in cases where a file-tab navigation interface is appropriate.]]>
