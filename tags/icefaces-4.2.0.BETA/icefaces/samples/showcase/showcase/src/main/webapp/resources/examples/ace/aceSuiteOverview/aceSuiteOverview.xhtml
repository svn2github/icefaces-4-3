		The Desktop Showcase provides demonstrations for the key features
		available in the ICEfaces ACE and ICECORE components.<br/>
	</p>
	<h2>ACE Components</h2>
	<p>The ACE Components (ICEfaces Advanced Components) utilize a
		blend of server-side and client-based rendering techniques to provide
		a rich, responsive user-experience with reduced network and
		server-processing requirements.</p>
	<p>
		Key features:<br/>
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li><b>&#187;</b> Leverage powerful JavaScript components from
			3rd-party libraries, such as jQuery, while shielding ICEfaces
			application developers from having to learn/use JavaScript directly.</li>
		<li><b>&#187;</b> Support extensive client-side functionality to
			improve component richness, responsiveness, and scalability.</li>
		<li><b>&#187;</b> Provide a flexible and consistent approach to
			UI theming/skinning across all components, based on jQuery
			ThemeRoller themes.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>The ACE Component containers and dialogs are best-suited for
		desktop or tablet platforms. All other ACE components are also
		generally suitable for use on mobile devices such as smart-phones and
		are intended to be used in a mix-and-match fashion together with the
		MOBI (Mobile) components to provide comprehensive support for
		authoring mobile web-applications.</p>
	<h2>ICECORE Components</h2>
	<p>The ICECORE Components (ICEfaces Core Components) are a set of
		none-visual utililities that provide ready solutions for common
		problems in many JSF applications.</p> These components work at the ICEfaces framework level and can be used in conjunction with any supported JSF components, on all platforms (Desktop or Mobile). <h2>How
		are the Components Licensed?</h2>
	<p>The ACE Components are made available under the Apache License
		Version 2 open source License. All code modifications and component
		enhancements are free for developers to use, distribute and modify.</p>
